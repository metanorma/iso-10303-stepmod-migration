= DEPRECATED: previous attempts to convert STEPmod CVS to Git

== Purpose

The goal is to import the CSV-managed files in a way useable via Git, with full history information.

Cloning a remote CVS repository while importing is super slow,
especially for a large repository like STEPmod.

Previous to the current approach documented at README.adoc, we tried the
following approaches.


== DEPRECATED approach 1: via `cvs-fast-import`

=== General

This guide is used as reference for the usage of `cvs-fast-import`:
https://oitofelix.github.io/article-savannah-cvs-to-git-migration/

We have tested and settled on these steps:

. Maintain a local `rsync` copy of the CVS repository.
. Resolve all names from the CVS repository (CVS only stores UNIX usernames, in Git are names and emails) using `cvs-fast-import`.
. Run `cvs-fast-import` to import the CVS repository into the `iso-10303-stepmod-cvs` Git repo.


=== Creating the `rsync` clone of the CVS repository

[source,sh]
----
rsync -avrPz -e ssh {{username}}@{{hostname}}:/stepmod/ stepmod-rsync/
----


=== Install cvs-fast-export

`cvs-fast-export` only works on Linux.
Run it on Ubuntu with the `rsync`'ed CVS directory.

Install:
[source,sh]
----
$ apt-get -y install cvs-fast-export
----

=== Getting all users for email mapping

Find all authors in the CVS repository using `cvs-fast-export -a`.
It is much faster than using the equivalent CVS command to list all authors.

[source,sh]
----
$ find stepmod-rsync -type f | cvs-fast-export -a
----


=== Create fast-import file for Git

After all authors are mapped, run `cvs-fast-export` to create
the import file.

[source,sh]
----
$ find stepmod-rsync -type f | cvs-fast-export -A author-map.txt > fast-import-file
----

=== Perform the Git fast-import

Once the fast-import file is created, we can perform the Git import.

[source,sh]
----
$ cd iso-10303-stepmod-cvs
$ git fast-import < ../fast-import-file
----


=== Upload the new Git repo

[source,sh]
----
git push --all && git push --tags
----


== DEPRECATED approach 2: Use `git cvsimport` (do not use, it won't work)

=== General

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11362676/how-to-import-and-keep-updated-a-cvs-repository-in-git[This StackOverflow post]
describes steps for using `git cvsimport`.

Originally the `git cvsimport` tool was chosen since it is part of
`git`. However, it utilizes a deprecated/unmaintained tool called
`cvsps`. The latest `cvsps` is version 3, but only version 2 is
compatible with `git cvsimport`.

In addition, the `cvsps` tool is maintained by the maintainer
of `cvs-fast-import`, and is no longer updated.
Eventually `cvs-fast-import` is used instead.

WARNING: This command completely fails
on this repository because it is too large and complex.


=== Setup

On macOS, run the following commands to setup for running the import. The `git` executable must be installed.

Install `cvsps` version 2.

NOTE: The steps from the StackOverflow of installing `cvsps` no longer work.

[source,sh]
----
$ brew tap Frizlab/Perso

# 🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/cvsps@2/2.1: 7 files, 124.6KB, built in 6 seconds
----

Verify it is installed:
[source,sh]
----
$ cvsps -v
# Can't open CVS/Root
# cannot determine CVSROOT
----

////
== Checkout the CVS repository

First set the `CVSROOT` and `CVS_RSH` variables.

[source,sh]
----
export CVSROOT=:ext:{{username}}@{{hostname}}:/stepmod
export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs checkout stepmod
# => stepmod/ is created in $PWD
----
////

=== Run the import

Run the import from CVS to Git.

Go to the directory that will carry the target Git repository.

Run `git cvsimport`.

[source,sh]
----
# Importing from remote
$ export CVSROOT=:ext:{{username}}@{{hostname}}:/stepmod
$ export CVS_RSH=ssh
$ git cvsimport -C iso-10303-stepmod-cvs -r cvs -k -v -d $CVSROOT stepmod

# Importing from local rsync'ed copy
$ export CVSROOT=$(pwd)/stepmod-rsync
$ git cvsimport -C iso-10303-stepmod-cvs -r cvs -k -v -d $CVSROOT stepmod
----

WARNING: TLDR. Technically this should work, but I ran into a `cvsps cannot allocate memory` error with 64GB of RAM, and not even completing the clone after 24 hours. So I gave up and switched to local. And local still takes a long time with tons of error messages. `cvs-fast-import` only takes 5-10 minutes to import.


=== Updating the CVS import

Run `git cvsimport` to synchronize the Git repo using updated data from CVS.

[source,sh]
----
$ git cvsimport
----
